# MoEQuant: Enhancing Quantization for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models via Expert-Balanced Sampling and Affinity Guidance

![MoEQUANT Logo](https://github.com/yourusername/moequant/blob/main/assets/logo.png)

## Overview

**MoEQUANT**, a novel post-training quantization framework tailored for Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) large language models, integrates Expert-Balanced Self-Sampling (EBSS) and Affinity-Guided Quantization (AGQ) to optimize both calibration and quantization processes. MoEQuant successfully quantizes MoE-based LLMs to low-bit precision with minimal accuracy loss, achieving near-floating-point performance and enhanced generalization across various models. This marks the first comprehensive PTQ solution specifically designed for MoE architectures.

This repository accompanies our ICML 2025 manuscript titled **"Enhancing Quantization for Mixture-of-Experts Large Language Models via Expert-Balanced Sampling and Affinity Guidance"**.
